\section{Research Opportunities}
\label{sec:oppo}
Beyond the research described above, we illustrate a number of research opportunities as follows: 

{\bf Utilizing other metadata fields.} 
We currently only leverage timestamp and Microsoft detection report. 
There are many other metadata fields. 
Investigating correlations among these fields could enable other big security applications. 
For example, there are existing techniques leverage submission\_id information to identify malware writers. 
For example, future research could leverage ssdeep information to cluster malwares, and conduct finer granularity malware prediction. 

{\bf Utilizing other AV vendorsâ€™ reports.}
We currently only leverage reports from Microsoft. 
Reports from Microsoft may not be always accurate, 
and there are more than 40 antivirus vendors' reports on VirusTotal. 
Which vendors' reports are most precise remains an open issue, 
and should be investigated in the future. How to combine reports from different vendors also remains an open issue. 

{\bf Improving antivirus products.} 
There are also opportunities to improve existing antivirus solutions. 
For example, most endpoint antivirus software, like ClamAV, are built based on malwares' signatures.
If we can precisely predict which malware would appear in the near future, 
we could reduce the size of signatures sent to clients' side and also reduce time to scan viruses. 

{\bf Studying other types of malicious files. }
Besides PE files, there are other types of malicious files on VirusTotal, like malicious apps, 
malicious URL, and malicious files on other systems. 
What are the characteristics of these files remains an open issue.
