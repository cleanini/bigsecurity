\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:meth}


We study all PE malwares submitted in November of 2015. 
In this section, we will firstly discuss how we collect data, 
and then we will present the general characteristics we observe.

\subsection{Data collection}

\caption{Metadata fields of each submission got from VirusTotal private API.}
\label{tab:fields}
\end{table}

We download metadata of each submission report through private API of VirusTotal.
Table~\ref{tab:fields} shows all metadata fields.
For one report, if its tag field contains either ``peexe'' or ``pedll'', 
we consider the report is about a PE file. 
It is possible that VirusTotal private API returns redundant reports, 
and we use the combination of md5 and timestamp to detect and merge redundant reports.
We only rely on Microsoft antivirus engine to judge whether the submission is malicious or not, 
and which malware family the malware belongs to. 
In total, we collect 43308091 reports and 4732502 PE malwares submitted
in November of 2015. 
The numbers of reports and malwares submitted each day are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:subnum}.


\textit{\underline{Threats to Validity.}}
Similar to all previous empirical study works, all our findings, experimental results, 
and conclusions need to be considered with our methodology in mind. 

VirusTotal private API only tracks which submission reports sent to each downloader approximately, 
and there is no guarantee that all submission reports can be successfully downloaded. 
It could be possible that we miss some malwares submitted to VirusTotal. 
We simply leverage Microsoft antivirus engine to decide whether one submission is malicious or not, 
and it is possible that Microsoft antivirus engine cannot make this decision precisely. 
However, how to get a precise label for each PE file is out of scope of this paper.  
Although there are huge mount of malwares on VirusTotal, we do believe that there are malwares never submitted to VirusTotal, 
and there are malwares submitted much later than when they appear in the real world, but there are no conceivable way to study these malwares. 
We believe that malwares in our study provide a representative malware sample of the real world.
