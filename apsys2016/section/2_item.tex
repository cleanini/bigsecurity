\section{Hot Malware Family Mining}
\label{sec:hot}

In this section, we view data on VirusTotal as a stream, according to each submission's timestamp, 
and apply a frequent item mining algorithm to identify hot malware family. 

Frequent item mining algorithms take two configuration parameters, $\phi$ and $\epsilon$, where $\phi > \epsilon$. 
The goal of frequent item mining algorithms are to provide nearly-real time analysis on massive data streams by using constant memory. 
Assuming the length of the input stream is N, the output of frequent item mining algorithms 
are all items which appear more than $\lfloor \phi N \rfloor$, 
and no items which appear less than  $\lfloor \epsilon N \rfloor$. 

The frequent item mining algorithm we use is space saving algorithm~\cite{space-saving}, 
which was proposed for streams in Internet advertising, and has already been applied in other areas, 
like mining hot calling contexts in profilers~\cite{hot-calling-context}.
