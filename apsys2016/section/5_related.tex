\section{Related works}

Many research efforts~\cite{bigcode, big-lessons,code-completion} 
have been spent to explore how to leverage ``big code'' repository, 
such as GitHub, BitBucket, and CodePlex. 
SLANG~\cite{code-completion} can fill uncompleted programs with call innovations, 
by using statistical models trained from extract sequences of API calls from large code bases.  

Learning from Big Code. 
1. Mining data from virustotal is a special case of  mining from software repository. 
a. Data is not the same from traditional software repository mining, binary code vs source code

2. Many security problems could also be identified through mining from software repository.
