\section{Related Works}
Recently, there are many works on exploring how to leverage ``big code'' repositories, 
such as GitHub, BitBucket, and CodePlex. 
SLANG~\cite{code-completion} trains statistical models from extracted sequences of API calls from large code bases, 
and applies trained models to fill uncompleted programs with call innovations. 
JSNICE~\cite{big-predicting} aims to predict identifier types and obfuscated identifier names for JavaScript programs. 
A score function based on learned CRF model is optimized to make all predictions. 
Phrase-based statistical translation approaches are used by \citet{big-translation} to translate C\# programs to Java programs. 
As a summary, all these techniques are trying to utilize source code repositories, which is different from our work.
