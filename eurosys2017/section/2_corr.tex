\section{Influence on Detection Rate}
\label{sec:corr}
In this section, we study factors influencing detection rate of PE submissions. 
Our study is conducted from 4 aspects: reputation of source id, submission history, 
file size, and source country.

\input{section/fig_2corr}

\subsection{Reputation of Source ID}

\label{sec:reputation}

Previous work~\cite{GuoICSE2010} reported correlation between bug reporter’s reputation and the likelihood for the bug being fixed. 
We also observe correlation between the reputation of source id and submission’s detection rate. 

%\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}{Reputation:}
Given a submission $S$ with source id $I$, 
we define the reputation of $I$ when conducting the submission $S$ as the average detection rate for all submissions conducted by $I$ before $S$. 
If $I$ did not make any submission before, we define the reputation to be $-1$. 
\end{definition}

For around 14\% PE submissions, VirusTotal fails to provide source id information. 
We filter out these submissions, when computing reputation.
All other PE submissions are conducted by 613 thousand source ids. 
More than half source ids (66\%) only conduct submission once. 
We filter source ids conducting more than 1 million PE submissions in our data set, 
because we think these are anti-virus vendors routinely test their products. 

When calculating reputation, we sort all submissions from the same source id chronologically, 
and calculate reputation for the id when conducting each submission. 
We round up each calculated reputation to nearest 0.05. 
We group submissions based on source ids' reputation when conducting submissions, 
and we plot average detection rate and 95\% confidence interval for each group in Figure~\ref{fig:idreputation}. 
Except the point with reputation 1, all other confidence intervals are invisible.  

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:idreputation}, 
there is a rough increase for detection rate as the increase of source id's reputation, 
with the exception for the point with reputation -1 and the point with reputation 1. 
It is interesting to observe that first submissions conducted by different source ids have higher 
detection rate than submissions conducted by ids with reputation 0, 
and it is difficult for source ids with highest reputation to keep highest reputation.

\subsection{Submission History}
\label{sec:history}

One file could be submitted more than once to VirusTotal. 
Given a submission, we also study whether information for historical submissions of the same file influences detection rate for the current submission. 

{\textit{\underline{Historical submission number.}}}
We sort submissions for each file chronologically, and then calculate the correlation between detection rate and historical submission number for each submission. 
All historical submission numbers are rounded up to the nearest 5. 
How detection rate changes with historical submission number is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hisnum}. 
The curve decreases from 0 to 10, increases from 10 to 65, decreases from 65 to 75, and increases after 75. 

We think there are two factors influencing whether detection rate would increase or decrease.
One is the percentage of benign files submitted to VirusTotal, 
and with more benign files submitted, detection rate will decrease.   
The other one is the percentage of engines identifying the submitted malwares, 
and with more engines identifying the malware, detection rate will increase. 
In the two stages of detection rate decreasing, 
VirusTotal users stop submitting identified malwares, 
and the increase of percentage of malwares submitted to VirusTotal dominates. 
The the two stages of detection rate increasing, 
more engines can identify submitted malwares, 
and the increase of percentage of engines identifying submitted malwares dominates. 

{\textit{\underline{Historical Source ID.}}}
One file could be submitted by one source id multiple times, and could also submitted by different source id. 
We also study correlation between the number of historical source ids and detection rate. 
Each number of historical source ids is rounded up to near 5. 
Average detection rate and confidence interval for each number of historical source ids are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hisid}. 
Confidence intervals are invisible before 80. 
Detection rate is higher, when the number of historical source ids is smaller than 15. 
Detection rate reflects how malicious of the submitted file, and the number of historical source ids reflect the popularity of a submitted file.
Figure~\ref{fig:hisid} shows that more popular files tend to be less malicious.   


{\textit{\underline{Historical Source Country.}}}
One file could also be submitted from different countries. 
The number of historical source countries also reflect the popularity of a submitted file. 
The correlation between detection rate and the number of historical source countries in 
Figure~\ref{fig:hiscountry} shows similar trend as the correlation between detection rate and the number of historical source ids in Figure~\ref{fig:hiscountry}. 

\subsection{File Size}
\label{sec:size}


File size information is also provided by VirusTotal. 
For each submission, we round up binary logarithm for its file size to nearest 0.5,
and calculate average detection rate for submissions with the same preprocessed file size.
Average detection rate and 95\% confidence interval for each preprocessed file size are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:size}.
Except for the last two points, all other confidence intervals are invisible.   
Files with size from 90KB to 4MB have average detection rate more than 0.2. 

\subsection{Source Country}
\label{sec:country}


All PE submissions in our collection are conducted from 222 countries, 
and for roughly 17\% PE submissions, 
VirusTotal fails to provide their source country information. 
We rank source countries, based on their submission number. 
Average detection rate for top 20 source countries are calculated and shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:Country}. 
Confidence intervals are also drawn for each source country, 
and all confidence intervals are almost invisible. 
From Figure~\ref{fig:Country}, 
we can see that submissions from different countries have significantly different detection rate.   

\subsection{Discussion}

{\textit{\underline{How to use?}}}
As we discussed from Section~\ref{sec:reputation} to Section~\ref{sec:country}, 
source ID reputation, historical submission number, file size, 
and source country are highly correlated with detection rate. 
Future work could train a regression model to combine all these factors together and 
predict how many engines could detect a malware or how malicious a malware is. 
By using the regression model or our studying results alone, 
security experts prioritize malwares, and focus their efforts on malwares which are more malicious. 
Anti-virus vendors could inspect results which are variant from our study results 
to identify possible false positives or false negatives in their products. 

{\textit{\underline{Limitations:}}}
As we discussed in Section~\ref{sec:meth}, our study is binded with our methodology.
We do not have any data before 05/07/2016, 
which may cause some reputation and historical numbers different from their real values. 
However, we think we can tolerate this problem, since we conduct our study in a relatively long time range and in a large scale. 
In the future, we could design our reputation and historical metrics based on a tunable time windows, 
and investigate whether correlations still exist.
