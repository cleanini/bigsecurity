We collect metadata for each submission through distribution API. 
Distribution API roughly tracks which data has been sent to which IP. 
If there is no new data, distribution API will return some recent data not sent to the IP before. 
After running distribution API for one day, most collected data is submissions conducted on the same day. 
We began our collection on 2016/05/07, and ended our collection on 2016/09/06. 



Table~\ref{tab:fields} shows the metadata fields and their meaning.
