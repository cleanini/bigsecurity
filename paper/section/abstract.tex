This paper calls for the attention to investigate real-world malwares in a large scale
by examing the largest real malware repository, VirusTotal.
As a first step, we analyzed two fundamental characteristics of Windows executable malwares from VirusTotal. 
We designed offline and online tools for this analysis.
Our results show that malwares appear in bursts and that distributions of malwares are highly skewed.
