VirusTotal contains the largest dataset for real-world malwares 
with labels from state-of-the-art antivirus techniques. 
In this paper, we study the characteristics of PE malwares on VirusTotal. 
We find that malwares appear in bursts and that distributions of malwares are highly skewed. 
We also argue that research community should pay more attention to the data on VirusTotal.
